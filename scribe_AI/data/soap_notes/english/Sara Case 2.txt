	•	Pharmacological option: Rx for nasonex nasal spray sent to pharmacy
	•	Reviewed that since symptoms are likely viral, no need for antibiotics at this time
	•	Given no evidence of bacterial infection in throat (no exudate or swollen tonsils), manage with non-pharmacological options
	•	Reviewed red flags including, but not limited to: chest pain, shortness of breath, excessive wheezing, go to ER
	•	If fever persists, sputum production develops, or patient feels generally unwell with no red flag symptoms, seek in person assessment
