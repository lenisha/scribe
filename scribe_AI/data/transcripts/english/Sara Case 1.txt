Speaker Guest-1: OK.
Speaker Guest-2: Which I started like a real consult.
Speaker Guest-2: You have to do like the privacy stuff like the introduce myself.
Speaker Guest-2: Hi Rebecca, my name is Sarah. I'm a nurse practitioner that works here at Telehealth virtual Care. How can I help you today?
Speaker Guest-3: Hi Sarah, I've actually I have acne and it's been getting worse over the past few months and my usual skin care routine doesn't seem to be working.
Speaker Guest-2: OK. And when did it start?
Speaker Guest-3: It started gradually getting worse over the last eight months, but it significantly flared up in the last three months.
Speaker Guest-2: And where specifically is your acne located?
Speaker Guest-3: It's concentrated on my jawline and chin, but I do have some lesions on my cheeks and upper back.
Speaker Guest-2: OK. And is this the first time that you've ever had acne or have you had acne in the past?
Speaker Guest-3: No, I've definitely had it in the past. I've had it since I was a teen. But the current episode has been intermittent for the past eight months. OK.
Speaker Guest-3: And do you find that there's anything that makes your acne better?
Speaker Guest-3: No.
Speaker Guest-3: OK. And have you seen that there's anything that makes it worse?
Speaker Guest-3: It seems to be worse around my menstrual cycle and when I'm stressed from school, but I've recently switched to a new moisturizer.
Speaker Guest-2: OK. And which moisturizer are you using?
Speaker Guest-3: I am using Sarah vape. Oh I'm using a cleanser Cerave. I think my moisturizer is the same and it has SPF 30 in it. OK cool.
Speaker Guest-2: And approximately if you had to estimate, how many lesions do you think you have on average when you get these flare ups?
Speaker Guest-3: 1515 to 20 I would say OK.
Speaker Guest-3: And when you?
Speaker Guest-2: Get these flare ups. Do you have any of the following characteristics at all? Like would you classify the acne as cystic?
Speaker Guest-2: Do you notice any white heads or inflammation or inflammatory, We call them inflammatory papules. They're like little bumps that are really red.
Speaker Guest-2: Pus that comes out of them, Any hard nodules? Is it really painful?
Speaker Guest-3: Yeah, I definitely do notice some bumps. I have a bit of redness.
Speaker Guest-3: On my cheeks.
Speaker Guest-3: And it's like so noticeable that it's like giving me anxiety to be out in public.
Speaker Guest-2: OK. And I know we talked a little bit about your moisturizer already, but what is your current skin care routine look like?
Speaker Guest-3: So I'm just washing my face with Survey, which is that foam cleanser that I mentioned. I use a retinol serum in the evening and then apply moisturizer. But yeah, during the day my moisturizer is SPF 30. OK, perfect.
Speaker Guest-2: And do you have any underlying medical conditions, things like PCOS? Have you ever been told that you have elevated blood sugars, high blood pressure, any cholesterol issues?
Speaker Guest-2: Nope. Nope, none of those. Any medications that you think might be triggering your acne?
Speaker Guest-3: No, but I have taken.
Speaker Guest-3: Benzoyl peroxide at 5%.
Speaker Guest-3: And.
Speaker Guest-2: Salicylic acid products, I'm kind of aside from that, I haven't had those are all over the counter and I haven't had any other previous prescription treatments. OK, perfect. And I'm just going to ask you a couple of questions regarding your reproductive health just so that I can make sure any treatments that Ioffer are safe to be given. Is that OK? OK. And when was the last, when was the first day of your last period?
Speaker Guest-3: November 28th.
Speaker Guest-2: OK. And is there any concern about being pregnant?
Speaker Guest-3: Nope. OK.
Speaker Guest-2: And are you breastfeeding? I'm not. And have you ever been on birth control in the past? No, I haven't. And I know you mentioned previous treatments for the benzyl peroxide and the salicylic acid.
Speaker Guest-2: Are you currently taking any medications? You mentioned you're using a retinol with that over the counter, OK. Are you taking any other medications over the counter prescribed vitamins or supplements?
Speaker Guest-3: Yes, I'm taking a multivitamin but nothing else. OK.
Speaker Guest-2: And do you have any allergies to medications?
Speaker Guest-3: No, no allergies.
Speaker Guest-2: Perfect. OK, so.
Speaker Guest-2: Based on everything that you've mentioned to me, it does sound like you have closer to the moderate side, somewhere between mild and moderate.
Speaker Guest-2: Acne and you mentioned you have bumps and some redness to your cheek.
Speaker Guest-2: Do you ever notice that you get You can make this up if you get flushed when you're really hot or if you're drinking any alcohol.
Speaker Guest-3: Yes, I do notice, particularly with alcohol, I noticed that.
Speaker Guest-3: OK.
Speaker Guest-3: And then I feel like it acts up when I'm like exercising as well.
Speaker Guest-2: OK, so there could be a little bit of a rosacea component to this as well, but it definitely sounds like you're having some acne to the chin, jaw line in the cheek area.
Speaker Guest-2: And it also sounds like it fluctuates and it's worse during your period, the time of your period. So there can be a little bit of a hormonal component to it as well.
Speaker Guest-2: So first of all, it's really important that you are cleansing your face properly. So the products that you use, Seraphine is a very well known dermatological.
Speaker Guest-2: Recommended option so you can definitely continue with the products that you're using. I know you mentioned you you you started using a new moisturizer recently. It's possible that this moisturizer could be irritating your skin and causing some of that breakout. So if you have used a different moisturizer in the past that didn't cause a breakout, you could try that one.
Speaker Guest-2: In general, Cerave, Cetaphil, those are pretty well tolerated moisturizers, but everyone's skin is slightly different so sometimes it's trial and error.
Speaker Guest-2: It's really important to use a non communogenic moisturizer so that we can avoid breakouts. If your skin is more on the dry side, it might be helpful to just wash your face once a day like in the evening and just use water in the morning just to avoid it getting overly dry, especially in the winter.
Speaker Guest-2: And then in terms of treatment, so my typical go to for starting treatment is something topical because you're sort of in that mild to moderate range.
Speaker Guest-2: And you might need more of a combination product. And I know you mentioned you tried benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid on their own without much effect, but it might be helpful if we do a combination where we do, we can do a combination of a benzoyl peroxide and an antibiotic or a, sorry, an antibiotic and a retinoid combination. And the one nice thing about the retinoid is it will help to reduce some of that redness, more of that inflammation, reduce the risk of scarring.
Speaker Guest-2: Umm, so that would be a recommendation that I have for you since you have a little bit more of the hormonal stress related acne. I think I would go with the combo retinoid and benzoyl peroxide as opposed to the antibiotic one to start. But again, everyone responds slightly differently to acne treatment so it is a little bit of trial and error and there are a lot of options.
Speaker Guest-2: The other option could be an oral contraceptive if we want to regulate your hormones. I'm not sure how you feel about starting an oral contraceptive, but that is always an option if you didn't want to go the topical route.
Speaker Guest-2: Or we tried the topical route and you're not happy with the results.
Speaker Guest-2: OK, that sounds good. I think I'll try the topical route first and then maybe if that's not working I can explore.
Speaker Guest-2: The the birth control route now, of course. OK, so the one that I would recommend is the tac tube pump. It's a combination of a retinoid and a benzoyl peroxide. It can be really irritating to the skin when you first start. So the recommendation I have is to use it either every other day or every three days at night and at a pea size amount every night.
Speaker Guest-2: Sorry, every other night or every three nights and see how your skin reacts to it and work your way up to every night as you start to tolerate it more and more. Make sure you're applying a lot of moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated. And it's really important that you're continuing with that SPF sunscreen because it can make your skin a little bit more sensitive to the sun. And if you ever have any concerns or you're feeling like it's not working, you can let us know. It is really important to remember it can take at least three months for us to really start to see an effect of these medications, so.
Speaker Guest-2: It's just important to be patient, but if you still want to change or you're not happy with the results, we can always reassess.
Speaker Guest-3: OK. That sounds great. OK, OK. Thanks, Sarah.
Speaker Unknown: No problem, Take care.
