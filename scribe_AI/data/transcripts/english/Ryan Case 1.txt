Speaker Guest-1: OK, cool. I'm ready. OK. Hi there. Hi, Doctor Wang. Hey. It's nice to meet you.
Speaker Guest-2: Nice to meet you too.
Speaker Guest-3: So if you can just tell me in in a sentence or two, what brings you here today?
Speaker Guest-1: You know, I was playing. I had a soccer game yesterday.
Speaker Guest-1: And I hurt my foot. It's really painful.
Speaker Guest-1: It was while I was playing.
Speaker Guest-1: And I had to come off the field and yeah, it's just really, really sore.
Speaker Guest-3: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a little bit more more about this like so, So First off, which foot is it on?
Speaker Guest-1: It's my left, my left foot.
Speaker Guest-1: Left foot. OK. And do you happen to remember what the mechanism was when you injured it?
Speaker Guest-1: Yeah. Oh, so I oh, you know what? I stepped on someone else's foot.
Speaker Guest-1: And then, yeah, my ankle rolled inwards.
Speaker Guest-3: Oh, OK. So sounds like probably a sprain, hey.
Speaker Guest-3: Yeah, I think so. Or it's broken, I don't know.
Speaker Guest-3: And in terms of the discomfort you're feeling now, whereabouts is is it localized too?
Speaker Guest-1: It feels like it's on the outside of my ankle.
Speaker Guest-3: OK. All right. And after you, you had to come off the field, were you able to walk around or put any weight on your foot at all?
Speaker Guest-1: I can, yeah, but I'm walking with a bit of a limp now.
Speaker Guest-3: Was there any other part of your lower extremity that was affected? So do you have any pain like elsewhere on your feet or in your legs? Your knee?
Speaker Guest-1: No, no pain elsewhere.
Speaker Guest-3: OK. And do you feel any numbness or or weakness? So like any numbness in your toes or difficulty moving the the leg? Nope. OK, all right.
Speaker Guest-3: Well, I think it would be helpful if I'm able to just take a look at your, your foot on the video here. So if you wouldn't mind just flipping your camera around and and show me your foot. Yep.
Speaker Guest-1: Sounds good.
Speaker Guest-3: All right.
Speaker Guest-3: So from what I can see, there's some swelling and bruising around the lateral aspects of your your left ankle, which makes sense given the way that it turned when you you injured it.
Speaker Guest-3: I'm wondering if you can just move your footer around a bit. So, so up and down, left and right. OK, All right. Yeah, it looks like your range of motion is a little bit limited there, which is understandable. And the the next thing I'm going to get you to do is just to press on a few different spots for me, OK?
Speaker Guest-3: So the the first area is on the outside of your foot where where it's probably most, most painful and swollen. There's a Bony protrusion on on the ankle. If you can just press down on that, is it tender when you when you press there?
Speaker Guest-1: No, not really.
Speaker Guest-3: OK, all right, the next.
Speaker Guest-1: Actually, yes.
Speaker Guest-3: That's that's helpful to know and if I can get you to move to.
Speaker Guest-3: If you go along the sole of your foot, so about halfway up the foot, you'll feel another Bony protrusion. This is called the base of your 5th metatarsal. Any pain there?
Speaker Guest-1: No.
Speaker Guest-3: No pain. Good, good. And the last spot I'll get you to press, it's at the very top of your foot. So kind of that the highest point you can you can touch.
Speaker Guest-3: On the sort of in the mid foot area, it's called the navicular. Any pain there?
Speaker Guest-1: No, no pain.
Speaker Guest-3: There.
Speaker Guest-3: OK, good. All right. And before I before I get into what I think this might be and and what we should do for it, just a few more questions to round out your medical history here. So do you have any chronic conditions I should be aware?
Speaker Guest-1: Of yeah, I do have asthma.
Speaker Guest-3: OK. And is it pretty well controlled or very struggling? Yeah.
Speaker Guest-1: Yeah, I think.
Speaker Guest-1: So.
Speaker Guest-3: Do you? Are you using any prescription medications regularly?
Speaker Guest-1: Yeah, I have an inhaler that I use roughly one puff daily.
Speaker Guest-3: OK, good. And do you have any allergies to medications?
Speaker Guest-1: I'm allergic to penicillin.
Speaker Guest-3: OK. Do you know what kind of?
Speaker Guest-3: Reaction it is.
Speaker Guest-1: It's pretty mild.
Speaker Guest-3: OK. All right. I'll make a note of that in your chart. So we make sure it's never prescribed for you. And sorry, I think one thing I need to clarify is just with the inhaler that you use, do you do you remember the name it's called?
Speaker Guest-1: Oh, it's a symbicort.
Speaker Guest-3: OK. Yeah, Yeah, you got it. OK. All right. So I'll add that to your chart as well. All right. So you know, based on our assessment here, I think you you definitely have have an injury to your left ankle and it sounds like it was an inversion injury. So which can often result in a sprain of the ligaments there. But of course like you pointed out earlier.
Speaker Guest-3: But we do want to make sure that this is not anything more concerning like a fracture. So some of the maneuvers I was getting you to do and, and to press around on, on, on your foot was to check for areas that can commonly be fractured in this type of injury. I think overall, like my index of suspicion is relatively low because you are able to walk around and put weight on it, which is always an encouraging sign.
Speaker Guest-3: But you, you did have some tenderness around the, it's called the lateral malleolus. They're just on the outside of the ankle where that bone is.
Speaker Guest-3: So what I'll do here is I will generate a requisition just for a walk in X-ray and I will get, I will get our office to send it into the closest imaging facility to you. And then that way you can go in and get it done within the next day or so and hopefully just to rule out any acute fractures there. Does that all sound good, make sense to you?
Speaker Guest-1: Yeah, that's great, Doctor Wade.
Speaker Guest-3: Thank you. Perfect.
Speaker Guest-3: In terms of things you can do at home in the meantime, just continue with icing it if you haven't already been and try to stay off it as much as you can while it's recovering. Some compression and elevation can be helpful as well, just to decrease the swelling there, OK.
Speaker Guest-1: Sounds good, all right.
Speaker Guest-3: Alright, no problem, Take care.
Speaker Unknown: OK, I think we probably need to stop this recording.
