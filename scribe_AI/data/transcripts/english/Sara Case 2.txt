Speaker Guest-1: OK. Any muscle or joint pain? No, not really. OK. And have you had any known sick contacts?
Speaker Guest-2: Yes, I was at work the other day and my coworker wasn't feeling very well and had very similar symptoms to what I'm feeling now.
Speaker Guest-1: OK. And are you finding that anything is making the cost better?
Speaker Guest-2: I tried some honey and lemon tea and it provided temporary relief and.
Speaker Guest-1: Are you finding anything makes the cough worse? I know you mentioned lying down makes the cough worse, is there anything else?
Speaker Guest-2: Cold air seems to make it worse.
Speaker Guest-1: OK. And have you tried anything to help alleviate the symptoms? I know you mentioned the lemon water and honey, Anything else that you've tried?
Speaker Guest-2: I went to Shoppers Drug Mart and I got some cough syrup, but it hasn't been helping that much.
Speaker Guest-1: OK. And do you know which one you got?
Speaker Guest-1: It was Dextro.
Speaker Guest-1: Mortherfan, OK. Dextromethorphan.
Speaker Guest-1: OK.
Speaker Guest-1: And do you have any underlying medical conditions like asthma, COPD, congestive heart failure, history of choking, heart disease?
Speaker Guest-1: OK, Perfect. And do you have any recurrent exposures at home or work to any chemicals, sprays, dust, pets? Nope. OK. And do you smoke cigarettes or do you have any consistent exposure to secondhand smoke?
Speaker Guest-1: No. OK. Perfect. And do you have any family history of any underlying lung conditions, seasonal allergies?
Speaker Guest-2: Yeah, my dad has seasonal allergies.
Speaker Guest-1: OK. And are you currently taking any medications consistently like over the cancer medications prescribed medications, vitamins or supplements?
Speaker Guest-2: No, just the cough syrup that I had mentioned.
Speaker Guest-1: And any allergies to medications? No allergies. Awesome. OK, so it does sound like this is likely a viral illness, just given that it was such it only started a few days ago and it's a dry cough.
Speaker Guest-1: And your sore throat is?
Speaker Guest-1: All these symptoms are quite consistent with the viral illness. I also took a look at your throat photo and I didn't see anything that was concerning. It definitely looks a little bit red, but your tonsils don't look swollen and I don't see any white spots, which again is quite consistent with a viral illness. Also, you mentioned you have post nasal drip, so the post nasal drip can cause a bit of a sore throat and some irritation.
Speaker Guest-1: So there's a couple things I would recommend. So for the cough, it's really important to stay hydrated.
Speaker Guest-1: You can definitely continue with the lemon water and the honey. Honey is really helpful to soothe your throat to help stop the cough. If you're not finding much of an effect from the cough syrup, then you don't need to take it. If you are finding it helpful, you can continue to take it. Everyone responds differently to it, but it isn't going to get rid of your cough. It will just help to sort of keep it at Bay or help relieve some of the symptoms.
Speaker Guest-1: Because it's viral, it will just go away on its own. Costs especially can last up to.
Speaker Guest-1: 10 days, even longer for some people if you are finding out all that, you're having chest pain, shortness of breath, a lot of wheezing, you're coughing up really gross colored sputum, you're having a fever that won't go away, you're feeling extremely unwell. Those would be reasons to go seek an in person assessment. The chest pain, the shortness of breath are more concerning signs of those that require ER. But if you just have general fever.
Speaker Guest-1: Coughing a lot, your coughing stuff out, you're not feeling well. You could start with just a family doctor's clinic or walk in clinic just to have someone listen to your lungs and see if there's any further assessments that need to be done. And you also mentioned your habits and post nasal drip. So a couple of things that can help with that. So propping your head up a little bit more at night you can.
Speaker Guest-1: Try a saline nasal spray or a saline nasal rinse. The nasal rinse is really important that you use sterile or distilled water, not tap water. You can always take tap water, put it out of running, boil for two minutes.
Speaker Guest-1: And then let it cool to the temperature to use with the saline packs. But tap water can actually increase your risk of a sinus infection. And then a humidifier in your room at night can also really just help to keep everything moisturized because it does get drier at night. You can do throat lozenges like halls or even Cepacol has a bit of a numbing agent in it if your throat is a bit sore and you wanted to try that.
Speaker Guest-1: And then?
Speaker Guest-1: The other thing that we could try if you'd like, I know you mentioned you're having a bit of facial pain and pressure and that post nasal drip as we can try a steroid nasal spray, you would do 2 sprays in each nostril once a day for about 7 days. If you find it's still not 100% gone, you can do it up to 10, but usually seven days is enough to relieve it and that can help prevent leading to an actual bacterial sinus infection.
Speaker Guest-1: Where you need antibiotics it will help dry you up a little bit so that it reduces the post nasal drip. And to use this I would recommend doing the ceiling spray or nasal rinse first and then doing the spray so that it actually gets into your sinuses. Do you have any other questions or anything?
Speaker Guest-2: And I get that just over the counter or is that a prescription?
Speaker Guest-2: So the cereal nasal spray, there is one over the counter but if you have insurance coverage then I would send a prescription and you can get it covered.
Speaker Guest-2: OK. Yeah, that sounds good. OK.
Speaker Guest-1: Perfect. If you don't have any other questions today, then I'll let you go and you can follow up at any point if anything's worsening or you have any other questions or concerns.
Speaker Guest-2: Yeah, that sounds great. Thanks, Sarah.
Speaker Guest-1: No problem, Take care.
