        "[Speaker 1]: Good Morning, doctor. May I come in?\n    [Speaker 2]: Good Morning. How are you? You do look quite pale this morning.\n[Speaker 1]: Yes, doctor. I've not been feeling well for the past few days. I've been having a stomach ache for a few days and feeling a bit dizzy since yesterday.\n[Speaker 2]: Okay, let me check. (applies pressure on the stomach and checks for pain) Does it hurt here?\n[Speaker 1]: Yes, doctor, the pain there is the sharpest.\n[Speaker 2]: Well, you are suffering from a stomach infection, that's the reason you are having a stomach ache and also getting dizzy. Did you change your diet recently or have something unhealthy?\n[Speaker 1]: Actually, I went to a fair last week and ate food from the stalls there.\n[Speaker 2]: Okay, so you are probably suffering from food poisoning. Since the food stalls in fairs are quite unhygienic, there's a high chance those uncovered food might have caused food poisoning.\n[Speaker 1]: I think I will never eat from any unhygienic place in the future.\n[Speaker 2]: That's good. I'm prescribing some medicines, have them for one week and come back for a checkup next week. And please try to avoid spicy and fried foods for now.\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, doctor, thank you.\n[Speaker 2]: Welcome."
